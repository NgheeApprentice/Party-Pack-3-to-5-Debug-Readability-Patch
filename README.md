Since the support updates for The Jackbox Megapicker, The Jackbox Party Packs 3, 4 and 5 have lost their debug font in each of their game's main SWFs; this makes all DeveloperConsole and Talkshow debug info unreadable.
This patch re-imports **Courier New** to each main game SWF from packs 3-5, allowing for usability in the DeveloperConsole and Talkshow debug tool once again.

### This patch was designed to support:
- The Jackbox Party Pack 3 (Build 12)
- The Jackbox Party Pack 4 (Build 16)
- The Jackbox Party Pack 5 (Build 12)
